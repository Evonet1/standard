# Grid Standard

This standard is developed collaboratively in the GitHub repository [open-dc-grid/standard](https://github.com/open-dc-grid/standard).

The website [open-dc-grid.org/standard](https://open-dc-grid.org/standard/) is only updated after each release. If you want to participate in the development, post [issues](https://github.com/open-dc-grid/standard/issues) or send [pull-requests](https://github.com/open-dc-grid/standard/pulls) on GitHub.

It is planned to auto-generate PDF documents from the markdown source files in the future.
